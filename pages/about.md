# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am an IT professional fresh out of school. I enjoy messing around in my home lab with different services and containers, as well as virtualizing network environments for testing and development. I have previously held a few certifications, though I unfortunately let them lapse during college. My current goals are to study and prepare to recertify my CCNA and maybe pick up some other certificates along the way.
